# Mathematical-Expression-Parser
An expression solver that uses pointers to parse strings and perform appropriate validation and returns the result.

Supports variables along with basic arithmetic operations(+ - * / ^) and parenthesis.

PS: I made this during my first semester project, when I didn't know about the concepts of stack!
